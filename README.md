# ElonDogeBot

Bot built back in the day when Elon moved the markets with simple tweets (he still does but less).
When activated, bot listens out for tweets from users specified (originally was just Elon, now you can choose)..
When a crypto coin name is detected in the tweet, a position is opened.
Would be cool to perform a more thorough sentiment analysis to decide the kind of position to be opened.


Use at own risk.
Repo now public as I thought it'd be a fun little showcase of my abilities.
